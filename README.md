# classic_algorithms
Collection of classic algorithms re-implemented in Python, including:

1. Karatsuba Multiplication - recursively apply Karatsuba multiplication in O(n^logn) time

2. Quicksort - quicksort algorithm using "median of three" for pivot and with a counter for number of comparisons in O(nlogn) time

3. Karger Minimum Cuts - finds the minimum number of cuts in an unweighted/undirected graph that disconnects the graph into two components in O(n^2) time

4. Kosaraju Strongly Connected Graph Components - identify strongly connected graph components in O(V+E) time.

5. Dijkstra Shortest Paths - identify the shortest path in a directed acyclic weighted graph in O(mn) time (implemented without heaps).

6. Median Maintenance with Heaps - keep track of (and in this implementation perform rolling summation) of median value as numbers are added to a list using heaps in O(nlogi) time.
